It is the policy of the City & County of San Francisco that all public meetings and events that are organized and hosted by City Departments and / or their contractors, are physically and programmatically accessible to people with disabilities. This checklist has been developed to assist event planners in ensuring that the facility and event set- up comply with Federal and State disability access laws.
Designated department staff, including Departmental ADA Coordinators, is responsible for referring to this material and ensuring that site accessibility has been verified before the event.
